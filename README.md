# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The aim of this analysis was to create a summary of the ridesharing data by city type for a large dataset using Python. Pandas and Matplotlib were then used to create a multiple-line graph that demonstrates differentiation in the data by city type, as well as how those difference can be used in decision making by PyBer. 

## Results 

The summary of ridesharing data provides information on total rides, drives, and fares, as well as average fare per ride and average fare per driver by rural, suburban, and urban sectors. As one would expect, the urban areas had the highest number of total rides by as much as 92% in comparison to rural areas; the highest total of drivers by 390% compared to suburban areas and 2987% more than rural areas. Alternatively, due to the high volume, the urban areas had the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver.

In the following table the resmaple() function was used to parse the weeks and then apply the sum() method to get the total fares for each week. This gives us a view of how the rural, suburban, and urban locations compare from week to week.
